            <source>Hi, My name is NAO. I'm a robot that solves the inverse matrix problem.  I can convert 1D and 2D matrices into inverse matrix. If you tell me a matrix, I will convert it into its inverse for you. Now, let me explain how to tell me a matrix, with an example. Let's say we have a matrix where the element in row 1, column 1 is 1, the element in row 1, column 2 is 2, the element in row 2, column 1 is 3, and the element in row 2, column 2 is 4. First, tell me '1'. Then I'll say, 'okay, number 1.0 added.' Next, tell me '2'. I'll say, 'okay, number 2.0 added.' Now, to move to the next row, say 'next'. I'll say, 'okay, next row.' Then you can tell me the numbers in the next row, just like you did for the first row. Now, I'll show you how I will respond with the inverse matrix. If the inverse matrix has 1 in row 1, column 1, 2 in row 1, column 2, 3 in row 2, column 1, and 4 in row 2, column 2, I'll say, '1 and 2 next 3 and 4.' Are you ready? If you're ready, say &quot;Start&quot; and if you want to hear it again, say &quot;Repeat.&quot;</source>

            <translation type="unfinished">Hi, My name is NAO. I can convert 2 dimension matrix with integer elements into inverse matrix. If you tell me a matrix, I will convert it into its inverse. Now, let me explain how to tell me a matrix, with an example. If the matrix has  '1' in the first row and first column,   '2' in the first row and second column,   '3' in the second row and first column,   '4' in the second row and second column.  First, tell me  '1'. Then I'll say, 'okay, number 1.0 added.' Then, tell me  '2'. I'll say, 'okay, number 2.0 added.' Now, to move to the next row, say  ‘next'. I'll say, 'okay, next row.' Then you can tell me the numbers in the next row, just like you did for the first row. If you’ve said whole elements, please say  ‘done.’ Then I'll calculate the inverse matrix, and I'll tell you. Now, I'll tell you how I will respond with the inverse matrix. If the inverse matrix has ‘1’ in the first row and first column,   ‘2’ in the first row and second column,   ‘3’ in the second row and first column,   ‘4’ in the second row and second column. I will say: “Okay, the inverse matrix is  ‘1’,  and,  ‘2’,  next,  ‘3’,  and,  ‘4’”. If you want to start calculating the inverse matrix, say 'Start.' If you want to hear it again, say 'Repeat. If you want to close this service, say 'exit’.</translation>
